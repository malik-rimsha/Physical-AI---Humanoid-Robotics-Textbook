# Physical AI - Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the Physical AI - Humanoid Robotics Textbook, a comprehensive guide to bridging AI agents with physical robot control using ROS 2.

## About This Textbook

This textbook focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, specifically on how to connect AI algorithms to physical control systems. You'll learn how to:

- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)
- Create Python AI agents that can control robots
- Define and model humanoid robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Modules

This textbook is organized into modules, with the ROS 2 module being the first and most fundamental:

- **ROS 2 Module**: The Robotic Nervous System - Learn how ROS 2 enables communication between AI algorithms and robot hardware

## Getting Started

Start with the ROS 2 module to understand the fundamentals of robotic communication and control:

1. [Chapter 1: The Core of ROS 2](./modules/ros2/chapter-1-core-of-ros2.md) - Learn about nodes, topics, and services
2. [Chapter 2: Programming Embodiment](./modules/ros2/chapter-2-programming-embodiment.md) - Create AI agents that control robots
3. [Chapter 3: Defining the Humanoid](./modules/ros2/chapter-3-defining-the-humanoid.md) - Model robots using URDF
